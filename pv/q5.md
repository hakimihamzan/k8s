- The access mode must be ReadWriteMany.

Verify the status of PVC and note it down on file /opt/pvc-status-before-consumption

Deploy a pod named my-nginx-pod using the nginx container image.Mount the PVC, test-pv-sc , to the pod at the path /var/www/html. 

After pod deployment, verify the status of the PVC and note it down on file /opt/pvc-status-after-consumption.
