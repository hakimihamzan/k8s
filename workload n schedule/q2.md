2. Create below deployment and check if it runs successfully.


apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: logging-application
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: logging-application
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: logging-application
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: log-generator # main application
          image: busybox
          command: ["sleep","1000"]
        

This application needs to be converted to a logging application. In order to do that use command - "/bin/sh", "-c","while true; do date >> /var/log/app.log; sleep 1; done". As you can see the application needs to write logs to path /var/log. So please mount an ephimeral volume to be used for logging.

Also please add a sidecar container which will read the main application logs and print to cosole output. This sidecar container would use image alpine and use command - "/bin/sh", "-c", "tail -f /var/log/app.log" to read logs. Make it possible for the sidecar to be able to read logs. Name for sidecar container - log-reader.

Check the logs of the sidecar to ensure it is printing date every one second.
