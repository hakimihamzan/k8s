Create a Pod named multi-container-playground in Namespace default with three containers, named c1 , c2 and c3 . There should be a
volume attached to that Pod and mounted into every container, but the volume shouldn't be persisted or shared with other Pods.

Container c1 should be of image nginx:1.17.6-alpine.

Container c2 should be of image busybox:1.31.1 and write the output of the date command every second in the shared volume into file
date.log . You can use while true; do date >> /your/vol/path/date.log; sleep 1; done for this.

Container c3 should be of image busybox:1.31.1 and constantly send the content of file date.log from the shared volume to stdout. You
can use tail -f /your/vol/path/date.log for this.

Check the logs of container c3 to confirm correct setup.
